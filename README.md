# CDTA

This code it is a automation code for the CDTA system, the code right now will make 10 replica of each SimOut.csv ,
and it also create a stack for those 10 replica, and then it will wait 10 seconds before it takes the most recent file 
(which is the top of the stack), into the merger.py and it will output a csv file.
